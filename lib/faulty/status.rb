class Faulty
  # The status of a circuit
  #
  # Includes information like the state and locks. Also calculates
  # whether a circuit can be run, or if it has failed a threshold.
  #
  # @!attribute [r] state
  #   @return [:open, :closed] The stored circuit state. This is always open
  #     or closed. Half-open is calculated from the current time. For that
  #     reason, calling state directly should be avoided. Instead use the
  #     status methods {#open?}, {#closed?}, and {#half_open?}.
  #     Default `:closed`
  # @!attribute [r] lock
  #   @return [:open, :closed, nil] If the circuit is locked, the state that
  #     it is locked in. Default `nil`.
  # @!attribute [r] opened_at
  #   @return [Integer, nil] If the circuit is open, the timestamp that it was
  #     opened. This is not necessarily reset when the circuit is closed.
  #     Default `nil`.
  # @!attribute [r] failure_rate
  #   @return [Float] A number from 0 to 1 representing the percentage of
  #     failures for the circuit. For exmaple 0.5 represents a 50% failure rate.
  # @!attribute [r] sample_size
  #   @return [Integer] The number of samples used to calculate the failure rate.
  # @!attribute [r] options
  #   @return [Circuit::Options] The options for the circuit
  # @!attribute [r] stub
  #   @return [Boolean] True if this status is a stub and not calculated from
  #     the storage backend. Used by {Storage::FaultTolerantProxy} when
  #     returning the status for an offline storage backend. Default `false`.
